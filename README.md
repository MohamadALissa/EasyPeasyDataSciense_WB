# Weights &amp; Biases with Google Colab
A simple example of how to use the Weights &amp; Biases library for experiments tracking (for EasyPeasyDataSciense page fans).

In this example, you will creat a project ('EasyPeasyDataSciense_WB'). Each run in this project will be tracked. That said, you will have in your Weights &amp; Biases page the following:
* EasyPeasyDataSciense_WB
    * run1 with set of parameters.
    * run2 with different set of parameters.
    * ....etc.
